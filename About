Simulating an actual cache using c++
Implented lru replacement policy 
Implemented a write back with write allocate cache policy
The instruction set:Example: rd 24 4 Here, rd -> read operation, 24 -> memory location,  4 -> block offset
Example: wr 67 8 100 Here, wr -> write operation,  67 -> memory location,  8 -> block offset,  100 -> data to be written
